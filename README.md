# Nature-Algorithms
Jane &amp; Co activities around digital art life

Being absorbed in the flight of the birds, well into the autumn, this project comes up to get closer to nature.

## Context

Boids is an artificial life program, developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, which simulates the flocking behaviour of birds. His paper on this topic was published in 1987 in the proceedings of the ACM SIGGRAPH conference. The name "boid" corresponds to a shortened version of "bird-oid object", which refers to a bird-like object. Incidentally, "boid" is also a New York Metropolitan dialect pronunciation for "bird". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids

So Flocking is a nice starting point https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flocking_(behavior) , as well as anything related to simulation of Birds Flocks and SPP https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-propelled_particles and cohesive flocks http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/12/9/093019
